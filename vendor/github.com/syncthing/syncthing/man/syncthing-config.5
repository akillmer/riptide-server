.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Syncthing uses a single directory to store configuration, crypto keys
and index caches. The location defaults to \fB$HOME/.config/syncthing\fP
(Unix\-like), \fB$HOME/Library/Application Support/Syncthing\fP (Mac),
\fB%AppData%/Syncthing\fP (Windows XP) or \fB%LocalAppData%/Syncthing\fP
(Windows 7+). It can be changed at runtime using the \fB\-home\fP flag. In this
directory the following files are located:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fBconfig.xml\fP
The configuration file, in XML format.
.TP
.B \fBcert.pem\fP, \fBkey.pem\fP
The device’s RSA public and private key. These form the basis for the
device ID. The key must be kept private.
.TP
.B \fBhttps\-cert.pem\fP, \fBhttps\-key.pem\fP
The certificate and key for HTTPS GUI connections. These may be replaced
with a custom certificate for HTTPS as desired.
.TP
.B \fBindex\-\fP\fI*\fP\fB\&.db\fP
A directory holding the database with metadata and hashes of the files
currently on disk and available from peers.
.TP
.B \fBcsrftokens.txt\fP
A list of recently issued CSRF tokens (for protection against browser cross
site request forgery).

element:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B id
The folder ID, must be unique. (mandatory)
.TP
.B label
The label of a folder is a human readable and descriptive local name. May
be different on each device, empty, and/or identical to other folder
labels. (optional)
.TP
.B path
The path to the directory where the folder is stored on this
device; not sent to other devices. (mandatory)
.TP
.B type
Controls how the folder is handled by Syncthing. Possible values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B readwrite
The folder is in default mode. Sending local and accepting remote changes.
.TP
.B readonly
The folder is in “send\-only” mode – it will not be modified by
Syncthing on this device.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B rescanIntervalS
The rescan interval, in seconds. Can be set to zero to disable when external
plugins are used to trigger rescans.
.TP
.B fsWatcherEnabled
If enabled this detects changes to files in the folder and scans them.
.TP
.B fsWatcherDelayS
The duration during which changes detected are accumulated, before a scan is
scheduled (only takes effect if fsWatcherEnabled is true).
.TP
.B ignorePerms

.TP
.B autoNormalize
Automatically correct UTF\-8 normalization errors found in file names.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following child elements may exist:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B device
These must have the \fBid\fP attribute and can have an \fBintroducedBy\fP attribute,
identifying the device that introduced us to share this folder with the given device.
If the original introducer unshares this folder with this device, our device will follow
and unshare the folder (subject to skipIntroductionRemovals being false on the introducer device).
All mentioned devices are those that will be sharing the folder in question.
Each mentioned device must have a separate \fBdevice\fP element later in the file.
It is customary that the local device ID is included in all folders.
Syncthing will currently add this automatically if it is not present in
the configuration file.
.TP
.B minDiskFree
The minimum required free space that should be available on the disk this folder
resides. The folder will be stopped when the value drops below the threshold. Accepted units are
\fB%\fP, \fBkB\fP, \fBMB\fP, \fBGB\fP and \fBTB\fP\&. Set to zero to disable.
.TP
.B versioning

.B copiers, pullers, hashers
The number of copier, puller and hasher routines to use, or zero for the
system determined optimum. These are low level performance options for
advanced users only; do not change unless requested to or you’ve actually
read and understood the code yourself. :)
.TP
.B order
The order in which needed files should be pulled from the cluster.
The possibles values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B random
Pull files in random order. This optimizes for balancing resources among
the devices in a cluster.
.TP
.B alphabetic
Pull files ordered by file name alphabetically.
.TP
.B smallestFirst, largestFirst
Pull files ordered by file size; smallest and largest first respectively.
.TP

.TP
.B ignoreDelete
When set to true, this device will pretend not to see instructions to
delete files from other devices.
.TP
.B scanProgressIntervalS
The interval with which scan progress information is sent to the GUI. Zero
means the default value (two seconds).
.TP
.B pullerPauseS
Tweak for rate limiting the puller when it retries pulling files. Don’t
change these unless you know what you’re doing.
.TP
.B maxConflicts
The maximum number of conflict copies to keep around for any given file.
The default, \-1, means an unlimited number. Setting this to zero disables
conflict copies altogether.
.TP
.B disableSparseFiles
By default, blocks containing all zeroes are not written, causing files
to be sparse on filesystems that support the concept. When set to true,
sparse files will not be created.
.TP
.B disableTempIndexes

transfers that are still in progress. When set to true, such information
is not exchanged for this folder.
.TP
.B paused
True if this folder is (temporarily) suspended.
.TP
.B weakHashThresholdPct

to \-1 to always use weak hash. Default value is 25.
.TP
.B markerName
Name of a directory or file in the folder root to be used as
marker\-faq\&. Default is “.stfolder”.
.TP
.B fsync
Deprecated since version v0.14.37.

.sp
Transfer updated (from other devices) files to permanent storage before
committing the changes to the internal database.
.TP
.B pullerSleepS
Deprecated since version v0.14.41.

.B compression
Whether to use protocol compression when sending messages to this device.

.SH SYNCING CONFIGURATION FILES
.sp
Syncing configuration files between devices (such that multiple devices are
using the same configuration files) can cause issues. This is easy to do
accidentally if you sync your home folder between devices. A common symptom
of syncing configuration files is two devices ending up with the same Device ID.
.sp
If you want to use Syncthing to backup your configuration files, it is recommended
that the files you are backing up are in a folder\-sendonly to prevent other
devices from overwriting the per device configuration. The folder on the remote
device(s) should not be used as configuration for the remote devices.
.sp
If you’d like to sync your home folder in non\-send\-only mode, you may add the
folder that stores the configuration files to the ignore list\&.
If you’d also like to backup your configuration files, add another folder in
send\-only mode for just the configuration folder.
