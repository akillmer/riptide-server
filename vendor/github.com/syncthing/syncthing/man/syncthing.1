.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Syncthing is an application that lets you synchronize your files across multiple
devices. This means the creation, modification or deletion of files on one
machine will automatically be replicated to your other devices. We believe your
data is your data alone and you deserve to choose where it is stored. Therefore
Syncthing does not upload your data to the cloud but exchanges your data across
your machines as soon as they are online at the same time.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-audit

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-auditfile=<file|\-|\-\->
Use specified file or stream (\fB"\-"\fP for stdout, \fB"\-\-"\fP for stderr) for audit events, rather than the timestamped default file name.

.TP
.B \-gui\-address=<address>

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-home=<dir>
Set configuration directory. The default configuration directory is
\fB$HOME/.config/syncthing\fP (Unix\-like), \fB$HOME/Library/Application Support/Syncthing\fP (Mac) and \fB%LOCALAPPDATA%\eSyncthing\fP (Windows).
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-logfile=<filename>

.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-logflags=<flags>
Select information in log line prefix, default 2. The \fB\-logflags\fP value is
a sum of the following:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
1: Date
.IP \(bu 2
2: Time
.IP \(bu 2
4: Microsecond time
.IP \(bu 2
8: Long filename
.IP \(bu 2
16: Short filename
.UNINDENT
.sp
To prefix each log line with date and time, set \fB\-logflags=3\fP (1 + 2 from
above). The value 0 is used to disable all of the above. The default is to
show time only (2).

.sp
Some of these exit codes are only returned when running without a monitor
process (with environment variable \fBSTNORESTART\fP set). Exit codes over 125 are
usually returned by the shell/binary loader/default signal handler. Exit codes
over 128+N on Unix usually represent the signal which caused the process to
exit. For example, \fB128 + 9 (SIGKILL) = 137\fP\&.
.SH DEVELOPMENT SETTINGS
.sp
The following environment variables modify Syncthing’s behavior in ways that
are mostly useful for developers. Use with care.
If you start Syncthing from within service managers like systemd or supervisor,
path expansion may not be supported.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B STNODEFAULTFOLDER
Don’t create a default folder when starting for the first time. This
variable will be ignored anytime after the first run.
.TP
.B STGUIASSETS
Directory to load GUI assets from. Overrides compiled in assets.
.TP
.B STTRACE
Used to increase the debugging verbosity in specific or all facilities, generally mapping to a Go package. Enabling any of these also enables microsecond timestamps, file names plus line numbers. Enter a comma\-separated string of facilities to trace. \fBsyncthing \-help\fP always outputs an up\-to\-date list. The valid facility strings
are:
